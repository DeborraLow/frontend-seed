# `assets/`

The `assets/` folder contains static assets such as images, fonts, svgs etc. SVG icons put into `images/sprites` will be automatically built into a spritemap by [svg-sprite](https://github.com/jkphl/svg-sprite)

```
assets/
  |- fonts/         // put fonts here
  |- images/        // put images here
     |- sprites/    // put .svg sprites here for compilation into spritemaps
```
